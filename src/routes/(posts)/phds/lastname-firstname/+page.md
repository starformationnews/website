<!-- Paste the abstract here!
N.B.: this *should* render LaTeX correctly, but could encounter issues. Our site uses a
web-based LaTeX renderer - KaTeX - which may differ slightly from the LaTeX environment
the author used at home. (The arXiv uses KaTeX, which is why we never have LaTeX problems
with the contents of paper abstracts.)

Common issues include:
- Having no gap between a $ symbol and other characters (e.g. $\sim$10 may cause an error)
- Using undefined math functions (e.g. things from the AMS Math package, which KaTeX may
  not include)

If an abstract causes the site to have issues, there are three potential debugging steps:
1. Try to look at the console in your browser (F12)
2. Look at the console where you did `npm run dev` (you might have to scroll back a bit),
   you should be able to find a KaTeX error
3. Try commenting out certain parts of their abstract one at a time until the error goes
   away.
4. Ask Emily =)
