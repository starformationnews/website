N.B.: this *should* render LaTeX correctly, but could encounter issues. Our site uses a
web-based LaTeX renderer - KaTeX - which may differ slightly from the LaTeX environment
the author used at home. (The arXiv uses KaTeX, which is why we never have LaTeX problems
with the contents of paper abstracts.)

Common issues include:
- Having no gap between a $ symbol and other characters (e.g. $\sim$10 may cause an error)
- Using undefined math functions (e.g. things from the AMS Math package, which KaTeX may
  not include)

If an abstract causes the site to have issues, there are three potential debugging steps:
1. Try to look at the console in your browser (F12)
2. Look at the console where you did `npm run dev` (you might have to scroll back a bit),
   you should be able to find a KaTeX error
3. Try commenting out certain parts of their abstract one at a time until the error goes
   away.
4. Ask Emily =)

The process of star formation frequently results in gravitationally bound pairs of stars. These multiple-star systems shape their surrounding protoplanetary discs, and the subsequent planet formation happening in their midst. Understanding the origin of planets in multiple-star systems is essential to interpreting global exoplanet demographics. This thesis investigates planet formation within multiple star-systems using a combination of high-angular resolution interferometric observations and state-of-the-art numerical simulations of protoplanetary discs. I thoroughly characterised disc dynamics in multiple-star systems, taking the example of a circumbinary disc in a triple system. Based on observations of that same system, I constrained the properties of dust grains and provided significant insights into the physical conditions under which planet formation takes place. Drawing upon the observed disc dynamics and grain properties, I quantified the dust growth levels in discs of binary systems using hydrodynamical simulations.The mutual gravitational interactions within multiple stellar systems strongly impact protoplanetary discs. These perturbations create a variety of structures, such as spiral arms, large cavities, or warps. Leveraging their signatures in the disc kinematics, I successfully constrained the orbit of a triple-star system and the long term dynamics of a circumbinary disc. Perturbed kinematics are thought to alter dust grain growth: stellar companions lead to local accumulation of dust grains, but also excite high collisional velocities between those grains. I provide tentative evidence that dust growth is limited by the inner binary in the dense circumbinary disc of V892 Tau. However, when compiling observations from other systems, it remains difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the true impact of stellar multiplicity on dust grain properties. Using numerical simulations including dust growth and fragmentation, I show that dust growth is indeed limited in circumbinary discs, whilst circumstellar discs are more likely to host dust growth levels comparable to isolated systems. Orbital eccentricity may even enhance dust growth by helping in the accumulation of dust grains, potentially promoting the onset of planetesimal-forming instabilities. This work advances our understanding of planet formation in multiple systems, offering a comprehensive view of disc dynamics and dust evolution under stellar multiplicity. It endeavours to contribute to a generalised theory of planet formation, including the impact of environmental factors on the way dust grains grow into planets.
