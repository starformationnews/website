N.B.: this *should* render LaTeX correctly, but could encounter issues. Our site uses a
web-based LaTeX renderer - KaTeX - which may differ slightly from the LaTeX environment
the author used at home. (The arXiv uses KaTeX, which is why we never have LaTeX problems
with the contents of paper abstracts.)

Common issues include:
- Having no gap between a $ symbol and other characters (e.g. $\sim$10 may cause an error)
- Using undefined math functions (e.g. things from the AMS Math package, which KaTeX may
  not include)

If an abstract causes the site to have issues, there are three potential debugging steps:
1. Try to look at the console in your browser (F12)
2. Look at the console where you did `npm run dev` (you might have to scroll back a bit),
   you should be able to find a KaTeX error
3. Try commenting out certain parts of their abstract one at a time until the error goes
   away.
4. Ask Emily =)

Outflows from young stars play a fundamental role in the process of star formation, acting as a dominant mechanism for angular momentum extraction from the star-disc system, regulating accretion onto the star. These powerful ejections, composed of high-velocity, collimated jets and slower-moving, wide-angled winds, are intrinsically linked to accretion and are launched perpendicularly to the disc surrounding the star. However, the exact mechanism for how these outflows are driven, the impact that they have on mass and angular momentum extraction, and subsequently, the impact they have on disc evolution and planet formation, is not well-constrained. This thesis presents an observational study of protostellar outflows from low-mass stars, primarily with the use of Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) with VLT (the Very Large Telescope) instruments, such as SINFONI, MUSE, and ERIS, allowing the spatial and kinematical analysis of these outflows in various emission tracers. A morphological and kinematical study of the HH 46/47 outflow in the near-infrared (NIR) using SINFONI reveals a stratified outflow structure in kinematics, chemistry, and temperature, and the presence of a velocity gradient transverse to the flow direction, providing insights into the launching mechanism. The investigation of the RU Lupi outflow in optical forbidden emission lines with MUSE presents the first images of the jet and low-velocity component of the outflow, allowing their kinematics, extents, and widths to be determined, and additionally the outflow efficiency to be explored, providing constraints on the launching mechanism. A multi-epoch proper motion analysis of the HH 46/47 outflow, using observations spanning nearly three decades, is presented, enabling a detailed characterisation of the temporal evolution of the outflow. The results presented in this thesis showcase the powerful use of IFS in the study of outflows, and offer new constraints on the outflow driving mechanisms and their role in angular momentum removal, contributing to our understanding of star formation.
