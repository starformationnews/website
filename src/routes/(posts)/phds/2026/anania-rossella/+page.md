<!-- Paste the abstract here!
N.B.: this *should* render LaTeX correctly, but could encounter issues. Our site uses a
web-based LaTeX renderer - KaTeX - which may differ slightly from the LaTeX environment
the author used at home. (The arXiv uses KaTeX, which is why we never have LaTeX problems
with the contents of paper abstracts.)

Common issues include:
- Having no gap between a $ symbol and other characters (e.g. $\sim$10 may cause an error)
- Using undefined math functions (e.g. things from the AMS Math package, which KaTeX may
  not include)

If an abstract causes the site to have issues, there are three potential debugging steps:
1. Try to look at the console in your browser (F12)
2. Look at the console where you did `npm run dev` (you might have to scroll back a bit),
   you should be able to find a KaTeX error
3. Try commenting out certain parts of their abstract one at a time until the error goes
   away.
4. Ask Emily =)

Characterising the physical processes driving protoplanetary disc evolution and the connection to the star-forming environment is essential to understanding planet formation and diversity. Most stars (and their discs) in the Galaxy form in massive clusters where the intense UV radiation emitted by OBA-type stars heats the outermost layers of protoplanetary discs, producing thermal winds that are launched from the disc surface. This causes outside-in disc depletion throughout external photoevaporation. In this thesis, I investigate how external photoevaporation shapes disc dynamics across a broad range of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields, focusing on nearby star-forming regions within 500 pc.

Using numerical disc evolution models, I show that external photoevaporation can efficiently truncate discs and shorten their lifetime even under weak FUV fields ($<1000$ G0), where no direct observational evidence of ongoing photoevaporation (i.e., proplyds) is currently available. I demonstrate that external photoevaporation must be included alongside with viscous evolution to explain the gas sizes and masses of the Upper Scorpius discs investigated by the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program. However, I discuss that obtaining model-independent evidence of external photoevaporation in moderately irradiated discs (1-100 G0), as in Upper Scorpius, remains challenging. I introduce a new method to evaluate the FUV flux at the position of stars that accounts for parallax uncertainty. Using the 2D geometry of a star-forming region, I derive the probability distribution of 3D separations from OBA-type stars. I apply this technique to provide an FUV flux map of the Orion region. Moreover, I investigate how the observed dust disc masses and stellar accretion  luminosities depend on the FUV radiation field. This thesis emphasises the importance of accounting for external photoevaporation in typical planet-forming environments in the solar neighbourhood and provides new tools that will be fundamental for future observations.
