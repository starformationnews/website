<!-- Paste the abstract here!
N.B.: this *should* render LaTeX correctly, but could encounter issues. Our site uses a
web-based LaTeX renderer - KaTeX - which may differ slightly from the LaTeX environment
the author used at home. (The arXiv uses KaTeX, which is why we never have LaTeX problems
with the contents of paper abstracts.)

Common issues include:
- Having no gap between a $ symbol and other characters (e.g. $\sim$10 may cause an error)
- Using undefined math functions (e.g. things from the AMS Math package, which KaTeX may
  not include)

If an abstract causes the site to have issues, there are three potential debugging steps:
1. Try to look at the console in your browser (F12)
2. Look at the console where you did `npm run dev` (you might have to scroll back a bit),
   you should be able to find a KaTeX error
3. Try commenting out certain parts of their abstract one at a time until the error goes
   away.
4. Ask Emily =)

Providing unprecedented sensitivities, spatial, and spectral resolutions, the latest generation of telescopes (NOEMA, ALMA, JWST) can now study the evolution of interstellar matter from star-forming regions to protoplanetary disks. Rich in gas and dust, protoplanetary disks are formed around young stars and constitute the cradles of planetary formation. In this PhD thesis, I aimed at better characterizing the evolution of young protoplanetary disks (a.k.a. Class I sources) in their natal environment. Class I sources are made of gas- and dust-rich disk(s) potentially forming planets, but are still embedded in cloud envelope material. Over the past decade, several spectral surveys probed the chemistry of Class 0 and Class II objects. However, little is known about the intermediate Class I stage chemistry. Secondly, using a variety of radiative transfer methods, I showed that the streamer is massive and should replenish multiple times the disk's material, suggesting big structural impacts on the star-disk system. Finally, by deriving chemical abundance ratios, I provided evidence that the streamer likely retains a chemical footprint from the prestellar core from which it originated, suggesting an interstellar heritage from the core to the disk through the streamer. This work underlines how crucial it is to study the natal environment of protoplanetary disks to better understand their evolution, both from a physical and chemical point of view.
