<!-- Paste the abstract here!
N.B.: this *should* render LaTeX correctly, but could encounter issues. Our site uses a
web-based LaTeX renderer - KaTeX - which may differ slightly from the LaTeX environment
the author used at home. (The arXiv uses KaTeX, which is why we never have LaTeX problems
with the contents of paper abstracts.)

Common issues include:
- Having no gap between a $ symbol and other characters (e.g. $\sim$10 may cause an error)
- Using undefined math functions (e.g. things from the AMS Math package, which KaTeX may
  not include)

If an abstract causes the site to have issues, there are three potential debugging steps:
1. Try to look at the console in your browser (F12)
2. Look at the console where you did `npm run dev` (you might have to scroll back a bit),
   you should be able to find a KaTeX error
3. Try commenting out certain parts of their abstract one at a time until the error goes
   away.
4. Ask Emily =)

Star formation is fueled by dense molecular gas residing in the dense and cold in-
teriors of molecular clouds. For decades, the emission of selected molecules, such as
HCN and HCO+, has been used to trace this dense molecular gas phase within the
Milky Way and external galaxies. Studies have revealed a tight link between star for-
mation rate and the emission of these molecules, observed on both sub-cloud scales in
the Milky Way and at kiloparsec scales in other galaxies. However, it has been recently
established that the properties of molecular clouds significantly depend on the galactic
environment they are residing in. Yet, observations of particularly the dense molecular
phase – the direct fuel of star formation that resides within those clouds – are often
limited to kiloparsec-scale resolution insufficient to access cloud properties or resolved
studies of molecular clouds in a single environment only. To understand how exactly
the large-scale galactic environments within galaxies are able to regulate the properties
of star formation within molecular clouds, it is essential to gain a cloud-scale view of
dense gas across a range of galactic environments.

This thesis provides the first piece in understanding this link, with the most compre-
hensive analysis of common dense gas tracers on cloud-scales across a diverse set of
galactic environments. “Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA”
(SWAN), is the largest cloud-scale mapping of 3-4 mm emission in an external galaxy
to date and the focus of this thesis.

The detailed view provided by SWAN shows that dense gas is not only confined to
spiral arms, but that its tracers emit brightly in the interarm region and galaxy center,
suggesting future star formation across the disk. The first time in-depth comparison
between common extragalactic dense gas tracers and the Galactic ‘gold standard’ tracer
N2H+ reveals significant variations with both large-scale environment and local cloud-
scale regions, which are undetected at coarser kiloparsec-scale resolution. Particularly,
the center of M51 emerges as an extreme environment in which the relation between
these dense gas tracers varies strongly. The utility of HCN emission in tracing gas den-
sity, breaks down when tested in M51’s (extreme) environments and HCO+ presents
itself as a more robust dense gas tracer. While studies from Milky Way clouds have
questioned the use of HCN in tracing high gas density regions, this is the first time
it has been tested at cloud-scales for entire cloud populations and the first time this
could be placed into the context of galactic environments. Our new insights on the
physical conditions that drive the dense gas emission reveal that gas density is not the
sole driver of their emission. This implies that second order dependencies on other
physical parameters like dynamical equilibrium pressure, star-formation rate and stel-
lar mass surface density have a pronounced effect and cannot be neglected in further
analysis. This thesis demonstrates the importance to place the star formation laws into
an environmental context.
