<!-- Paste the abstract here!
N.B.: this *should* render LaTeX correctly, but could encounter issues. Our site uses a
web-based LaTeX renderer - KaTeX - which may differ slightly from the LaTeX environment
the author used at home. (The arXiv uses KaTeX, which is why we never have LaTeX problems
with the contents of paper abstracts.)

Common issues include:
- Having no gap between a $ symbol and other characters (e.g. $\sim$10 may cause an error)
- Using undefined math functions (e.g. things from the AMS Math package, which KaTeX may
  not include)

If an abstract causes the site to have issues, there are three potential debugging steps:
1. Try to look at the console in your browser (F12)
2. Look at the console where you did `npm run dev` (you might have to scroll back a bit),
   you should be able to find a KaTeX error
3. Try commenting out certain parts of their abstract one at a time until the error goes
   away.
4. Ask Emily =)

Stars form through the accretion of gas via circumstellar disks. For this accretion to occur, the system must extract angular momentum from the disk through winds, jets, and outflows. Early in the evolution of the disk, molecular outflows can also disperse part of the surrounding envelope, affecting the disk mass and chemical composition. At later stages, ionizing radiation from the star can generate photoevaporative winds that disperse the disk from the inside out. Furthermore, as many stars are born in multiple systems, interactions between companions can alter and sweep internal regions of the disk, limiting its ability to form planets. Although dispersion mechanisms in low-mass stars have been studied in advanced stages, we still do not understand their impact on very young systems. In massive stars, the study is more complex due to their scarcity and large distances, but state-of-the-art telescopes such as ALMA and the VLTI now allow detailed, high-resolution observations. By employing these telescopes in combination with models, we address the role of the different dispersal mechanisms on the evolution of the disk. Among our sample, we find that magneto-hydrodynamic winds appear to dominate the dispersion of massive disks over photoevaporative winds, even in the presence of intense ionizing radiation. Accretion can continue for extended periods, and disks survive until late stages, keeping material available to form planets. In addition, binary companions are observed to have a significant influence on the disk and the outflow structure, revealing disk gaps and multiple outflows. Obtaining high-resolution observations at multiple wavelengths and analyzing them with detailed models is essential to fully understand these dispersal processes.
