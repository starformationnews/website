Welcome back to _The Star Formation Newsletter_'s first edition since its hiatus. Thank you to everyone who submitted abstracts for this month -- it has been incredible to see the response from the community to the SFN's return.

We wanted to quickly answer a few frequently asked questions about the new website:

1. **Papers are ordered randomly.** Papers with the same subtitle (such as those in a series) are grouped together.
2. We currently accept abstracts of papers submitted to the arXiv **no more than three months before the current month**. For example: this issue (January 2026) includes submissions from 1st November 2025 onwards.
