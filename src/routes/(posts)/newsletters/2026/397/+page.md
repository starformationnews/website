Welcome back to _The Star Formation Newsletter_'s first edition since its hiatus. Thank you to everyone who submitted abstracts for this month -- it has been incredible to see the response from the community to the SFN's return.

We wanted to quickly answer a few frequently asked questions about the new website:

1. **Papers are ordered randomly.** Papers with the same subtitle (such as those in a series) are grouped together.
2. We currently accept abstracts of papers submitted to the arXiv **no more than three months before the current month**. For example: this issue (January 2026) includes submissions from 1st November 2025 onwards.
3. We will aim to publish new newsletters by the **third working day** of the following month.
4. We are planning on adding **PDF versions of the newsletter [soon](https://github.com/starformationnews/website/issues/1)**; for now, you can read the newsletter as a PDF by printing the page to PDF in your web browser.
5. The entire SFN is now [**open source**](https://github.com/starformationnews), helping to ensure its sustainability into the future. If you have any suggestions for the new website, feel free to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/starformationnews/website/issues).

And now: onto the abstracts!
