# Default images

This folder mostly exists for providing a few default images, so that it isn't necessary to always upload an image.

Please only add images in .webp format with a maximum width of 2000 pixels, and a minimum of ~1500. (Any more or less won't work in all cases, or is unnecessary.)

Please add image credits to `credits.json`, following the template:

```javascript
{
    ...
    "filename": {
        "credit": "full list of required credit. E.g.: ESO/Joe Bloggs",
        "license": "license (if known. which it should be. free to use only please!) E.g.: CCA 4.0",
        "url": "a url of where you found the image, for our own sake - e.g. wikimedia commons or the ESO website."
    },
    ...
}
```
